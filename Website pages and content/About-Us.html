                    <p>This business was founded by Fungai Makombe, my father’s younger brother Paul Makombe. In 2014 this business was<br> 
                        officially registered as a trade and export business. This business used to import and export goods only no manufacturing<br>
                        was being done as Fungai Makombe conducted this business using his phone to communicate orders<br>
                        to those he worked with so they receive the goods and are paid for packaging the goods,<br>
                        then a buyer is found, and he would get paid from the comfort of his home.<br>
                        There were times when he needed to be there before goods (which were peanuts and Kapenta fish) <br>
                       were transported or traveled to certain parts of the world in African countries.<br>
                        This was when the quality of the goods needed to be checked<br>
                       , and he had to make sure that everything was according to the taste of the specific client. </p>

                       <p>Makombe, FT.2023.Images of Kapenta fish, and Peanuts </p>
                        <P>Fast forward to 2 to 3 years, this was when he started hiring workers and was a more hands-on businessperson. He has said that, and I quote <br>
                            “I’m doing this for the family that surrounds me that does not have a stable source of income, so it helps them “.<br>
                            He could have easily continued doing business on his phone. This meant that now instead of just <br>
                            paying his professional partners he hired family and those around him that he saw needed<br>
                             help to start parking the Kapenta fish in packaging that were then parked in packs<br>
                             and sold in balks, the peanuts come in raw form, and needed to be pealed and delivered <br>
                            to those that manufacture peanut butter, and he hired workers to do that too, <br>
                            and my siblings and I would sometimes help to get extra pocket money. </P>

                            <P>Then everything went downhill when COVID-19 struck, and it was no longer safe so every country <br>
                            went under lockdown meaning no income was being  generated but the government created means to<br>
                             make sure every household was fed.When the lockdown was lifted it was safer to work and go back to school.<br>
                             My father Paul Makombe had lost the  means of creating income as his local business had lost goods,<br>
                             he decided to work with his younger brother in his business as it had much more potential. <br>
                            That was when Fungai Makombe’s business started to manufacture tertiary goods<br>
                             (which is the final product produced from raw materials) in his case he started producing<br>
                             peanut butter in the year 2020 right after the lockdown was lifted. This was when he now had <br>
                            to find a more suitable place to work, and the machinery used for manufacturing peanut butter.<br>
                             This business still to this day has no social media platform to advertise its Goods and Services.</P>
